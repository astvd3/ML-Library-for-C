# ML-Library-for-C
Machine Learning Library for C

A small-ish library for Machine Learning stuff. Possibly for small scale microcontrollers but I don't know. I have just started writing it. What it will become? We will see in coming weeks.
This has no dependencies. 

## Inludes
- Linear Regression
- Neural Networks

## Soon to be implemented
- SVN
- PCA
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial Regression.
